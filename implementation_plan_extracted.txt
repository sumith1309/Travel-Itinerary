Phase 1: Backend Foundation
■  WEEKS 1–4  |  BACKEND ARCHITECTURE & DATA LAYER
Phase 1 establishes the entire backend infrastructure: database schema, API layer, authentication system, AI service integration, caching, and comprehensive seed data. By the end of this phase, every API endpoint is functional and testable, enabling the frontend team to build against real data.
1.1 Week 1: Project Setup & Database Architecture
Project Scaffolding
Initialize Next.js 15 project with App Router, TypeScript strict mode, and Turbopack
Configure Tailwind CSS 4 with brand color system and design tokens
Set up Prisma ORM with Neon Serverless PostgreSQL connection pooling
Configure ESLint, Prettier, Husky pre-commit hooks, and commitlint
Create .env.example with all environment variables documented
Initialize Git repository with branch protection rules
Database Schema Implementation
Deploy the complete Prisma schema covering all bounded contexts:
[TABLE START]
Schema Group | Models | Key Relationships
Users & Auth | User, Account, Session, VerificationToken, TravelProfile, TravelHistory | User → TravelProfile (1:1), User → TravelHistory (1:N)
Destinations | Region, Country, City, PointOfInterest | Region → Country → City → POI (hierarchical)
Experiences | Experience | Linked to destinations via slug arrays
Itineraries | Itinerary, ItineraryDay, ItineraryItem, SavedItinerary | Itinerary → Day → Item (nested), POI cross-ref
Visa | VisaInfo | Country → VisaInfo (1:N by type)
Content | BlogPost, BikeTour, HiddenGem | Tag-based linking to destinations
Chatbot | ChatSession, ChatMessage | User → Session → Messages
Personalization | UserEmbedding, BehaviorEvent, Notification | User behavioral data pipeline
Newsletter | NewsletterSubscriber | Standalone
[TABLE END]
Deliverables
Prisma schema with 25+ models, all migrations applied to Neon
Database indexes optimized for read-heavy patterns (slugs, user queries, timestamps)
Type-safe Prisma client singleton with connection pooling for serverless
1.2 Week 2: Authentication & Core API Layer
Authentication System
Implement NextAuth.js v4 with JWT strategy (30-day token lifetime)
Email/password registration with bcrypt hashing (cost factor 12)
Google OAuth integration for frictionless sign-up
Auto-creation of TravelProfile on first registration
Protected route middleware with role-based access control
API Framework & Utilities
Build the reusable API infrastructure layer:
Standardized response format: { data, meta: { pagination } } for success
RFC 7807 Problem Details for errors: { type, title, status, detail, errors }
Zod validation schemas shared between client and server
withErrorHandler() wrapper: catches Zod, Prisma, and custom ApiError types
withRateLimit() wrapper: in-memory for prototype, Upstash for production
requireAuth() and optionalAuth() helper functions
Cursor-based pagination with configurable limits
Core API Endpoints — Week 2
[TABLE START]
Route | Method | Description | Auth
/api/auth/register | POST | Email/password registration with validation | Public
/api/auth/[...nextauth] | ALL | NextAuth.js handler (login, logout, session) | Public
/api/users | GET | Current user profile with travel data and stats | Required
/api/users | PATCH | Update profile or travel preferences | Required
/api/users | POST | Log travel history or track behavior events | Required
/api/destinations | GET | List countries with region/budget filtering + pagination | Public
/api/destinations/[slug] | GET | Full country detail with cities, POIs, visa, samples | Public
[TABLE END]
1.3 Week 3: AI Service & Advanced APIs
Claude AI Integration
Implement the complete AI service layer with three operational modes:
[TABLE START]
Mode | Use Case | Architecture | Response
Chat (Streaming) | Conversational trip planning | SSE via ReadableStream, conversation history managed in DB | Real-time streamed text via Server-Sent Events
Chat (Standard) | Quick Q&A, visa queries | Single request-response via Claude API | Full text response in JSON
Itinerary Generation | Structured day-by-day plan creation | Structured JSON output with system prompt enforcement | Parsed GeneratedItinerary object saved to DB
Recommendation Analysis | Personalized destination suggestions | User profile + travel history as context, JSON output | Ranked recommendations with match scores
Preference Analysis | Behavioral insight extraction | Behavior events + profile, inferred interests | Updated user preference profile
[TABLE END]
System Prompt Architecture
Two specialized system prompts power different AI modes:
Chatbot Prompt: India-contextualized travel assistant that references user travel history, respects dietary preferences, provides INR budgets, and avoids repeating visited destinations.
Itinerary Engine Prompt: Structured JSON generator producing day-wise plans with morning/afternoon/evening blocks, transport logistics, budget breakdowns, and vegetarian food recommendations.
RAG Context Assembly
Before each AI call, the system assembles a context document from the destination database:
Query Prisma for country + cities + POIs matching the user's request
Format as structured text with costs in INR, opening hours, transport info
Inject user's travel profile (style, budget, dietary preferences) into system prompt
Include travel history as exclusion list (“avoid these unless asked”)
Assemble conversation history (last 20 messages) for multi-turn coherence
Additional APIs — Week 3
[TABLE START]
Route | Method | Description | Auth
/api/itineraries | GET | List itineraries (my/samples/public) with filters | Optional
/api/itineraries | POST | Create manual or AI-generate itinerary | Required
/api/chatbot | GET | List user's chat sessions | Required
/api/chatbot | POST | Create session or send message (SSE streaming) | Required
